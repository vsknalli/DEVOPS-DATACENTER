1) What is the purpose having different ports in Linux server ?
	Each server in Linux have to communiate through IP &  the IP trouch port.

Example:
--------
server-A --> Running two service on it , let say the one is DNS and the other is NFS 
When you are communicating to that server and you want to talk to DNS service , Then that DNS service have its own 
deditcated port and that port is 53.
	Same way if you want to communicate to NFS service on the same server , it is recomendated that we should run 
seach service separetley. NFS-2049

Suppose if the Onse server is serving 10 services then we need 10 ports .Thats the reason behind different port runs on one server.

2) Tell us about /etc/password in Linux ?
This first field is always the username
1 --> Username
2 --> x - Password column 
3 -UID assigned to the user
4 GroupID -- Which group the userid belongs 
5 User Describtion
6 Home Directory /home/vsk
7 Shell --> The shell where the user is using 
-------------------------------------------------------------

Explain about Cron job ?
How you schedule cron job and telll me what are the dirrerent fields of cron job or the syntax ?
if youur cron job doesn't run how will you trouble-shoot?
Ans:
==== In order to run the cron job we need to run # crontab -e 
-e is for editing, once we run it will open vi edirot 
1) Miniutes 
2) Hour 
3) Day-of-the-Month
4) Month
5) Day-of-the-week

Trubleshoot--> First we need to check cronjob logs /var/log/cron & /var/log/messages file also we need to check we need to check
the mail as well 
peole doesn't realize the actual syntax entry inside the cron 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) Boot-sequance in Linux ?
 The boot sequance changes in centos 7/Redhat7 and above 	
 Systemd is the new service manager in centos7/Redhat7 that manages the boot sequanc 
 It is backward compatible with sysV init scripts used by previous versions of Rehat including Rhel-6
 Every system administrator need to understand the boot process of an OS inorder to trubleshoot effectively
 
 The first thing first is as soon as we power on a machine or a computer it actually have fireware in it, Remember, that 
the firmware has nothing to do with operating system. That fireware actually comes in with that machine preinstalled by 
that manufacture.That firmwaer is called BIOS whch is refered to as basic input and output settings.so its starts up and 
it goes through the POST process means it startsup then it goes through all the hardware that is attched , it goes through 
every one of them and checks the Health.
	If all good to go the the MBR is loaded , whiach is stand for Master Boot Record, information is saved in the 
first sector of the Harddrive -> which indicates where the Grub2 is located , so it can be loaded into the computor RAM
	Basically Grub2 job is to load the kernel, the Linux kernel , That information is in /boot/grub2/grub.config 

Now the kernel comes up , kernel is the core of the operating system, which loads required drivers from initrd.img file
in order to comunicate the kerlel with hardware which requires drivers that talk to the Hardware
Loads all the drivers and it starts the first OS process That is called "systemd" , by default it is given the process id 
of number 1 , and it all reuired processs and thatn 

	it reads /etc/systemd/system/default.target to bring the system into the run-level 
Linux system has 0-6 total 7 Runlevels , The default run level has been defined in this /etc/systemd/system/default.target file
Which reads this file and bring the system into default run level.

4) Explain the difference between RAID0, RAID1 & RAID5 ?
RAID0:
----- Is concodination and stripe , inorder to avail more disk space and make read-write performance we can go with 
Raid -0 mostly which is used for Data-Where Housing and Backup , The disadvantage of Raid 0 is if one disk fails we loose 
the data, i mean there is no data redencency in Raid-0.

RAID-1
------RAID-1 eleminate the disadvantage of Raid-0 where we loose one disk we loose the data , since we mirror we wont loose 
the data in Raid-1.whch provides data high availability. 

RAID-5
------ To solve all this 0 and 1 we can come up with Raid-5 , Raid-5 is stripping with parity , we need to have 3 or more disks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Explain about NIC Bonding ?
Why do we need NIC-Bonding and what is the purpose of NIC-Bonding ?
How the NIC-bonding works?
HOw to configure NIC bonding?

Why do we need NIC-Bonding:
-----------------------------> NIC Netowrk Interface Card , We have Netowrk port , that port is connected with ehternet cable
That ether net cable connected with is to provide the internet service or netwok service to communicate with one server to 
another , In production environment server if the one NIC fails , the communiation & the work flow is down which leads 
business impact to avid this situvation we bring NIC bonding to make the network availability via boding two NIC together,
With the hlep of this NIC bonding we get redency and bandwith as well .

Configuration:
--------------> First we need to make sure the NIC driver exists on the server that allow to do bonding , if not installed 
the drive using the command modepobe 
And for binding both NIC we need to do modification in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/bond0 and bond-1 
Put some perametes 	
To validate the configuration --> systemctl reload network
