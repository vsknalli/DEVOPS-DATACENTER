1) What is the purpose having different ports in Linux server ?
	Each server in Linux have to communiate through IP &  the IP trouch port.

Example:
--------
server-A --> Running two service on it , let say the one is DNS and the other is NFS 
When you are communicating to that server and you want to talk to DNS service , Then that DNS service have its own 
deditcated port and that port is 53.
	Same way if you want to communicate to NFS service on the same server , it is recomendated that we should run 
seach service separetley. NFS-2049

Suppose if the Onse server is serving 10 services then we need 10 ports .Thats the reason behind different port runs on one server.

2) Tell us about /etc/password in Linux ?
