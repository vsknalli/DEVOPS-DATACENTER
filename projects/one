Docker file explanation:
=========================

1) FROM --> First one is FROM to pull the base imaeg, Allmost all the Dockerfile starts with FROM instruction. It tells you that 
what is the base image do you require to start with your Dockerfile 

2) RUN --> To execute commands, if you have some shell commands like installing packages, Creating users, etc almost 
all the shell commands we can execute with the RUN command instruction on Dockerfile.

3) CMD  --> To provides defaults for an executing container, CMD instruction get executed at the time of docker execution 

4) ENTRYPOINT  -->  Its also similar to CMD get executed at the time of container execution , However CMD can be commands
can be overwritten but ENTRYPOINT commands are not overwritten. And CMD can be work like aguments for ENTTRYPOINT .

5) WORKDIR --> It is something like CMD command if we wish to switch our directory within the container Then we could
use workdir instruction.

6) COPY --> Copy a directory from your local(docker-host) machine to the docker container.

7) ADD --> Copy a files and folders  from your local machine (docker-host) to docker container. We can also use this 
command like wget command. 

8) EXPOSE --> Informs docker that the container listens on the specified network-porta at runtime . 

ENV --> To set the environment variables .
