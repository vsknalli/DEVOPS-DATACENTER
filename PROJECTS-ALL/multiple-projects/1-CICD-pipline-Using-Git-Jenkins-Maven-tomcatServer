1) Build and deploy on Tomcat server 
Setup CICD with GitHub-->Jenkins-->Maven and Tomcat

(i) setup Jenkins server
=========================-
	> Setup Linux server 
	> Install Java
	> Install Jenkins
	> Start Jenkins
	> Access web UI on port 8080
After we setup the jenkins server we can try & Run First-Jenkins-job
Newitem --> Enter item Name --> Freestyle --> Description --> Build ...etc..etc.


(ii) Setup and configure Maven and Git
========================================
		We are in the process of setting up pipeline to build out code for this sofar we have installed Jenkins
and our code is on our GitHub.
		Usally to pull the code from GitHub or anyvesion contrll system our system show have Git, Similar way to pull
the code onto jenkins we should install Git over jenkins-server , so on Jenkins cli first we need to insall git and 
then we can integrate GitHub with Jenkins on the GUI.

Steps:
-----
	1) First we need to install Git on Jenkins-server on cli
           # apt install git
	2) Install GitHub plugin on Jenkins-GUI After that 
           manageJenkins-->plugins-->github-->install withour restart  (Because i want integrate GitHub to Jenkins)
	3) Configure Git on Jenkins-GUI
	   ManageJenkins-->GlbalTool-->to to Git installation give the git path
These are the three stypes we shoull follow

RUN FIRST JOB PULL CODE FROM GITHUB:
===================================
Newitem-> jobname->Freestyle-ok---->Decription--> SCM-<URL> --> Apply and Save it --> BuildJOb
Successfully cloned on to our jenkins servers in workspace (in server path /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<JObName> see in
Jenkinsserver in this path.)
	
INTEGRARE MAVEN WITH JENKINS:
=============================
Normally we can user Maven as a seperate Build server , to reduce the complexcivy here we are using Jenkins server as 
as Build server for that 
	1) setup Maven on Jenkins server
	2) we Need to setup Environment Variable, Maven is a java based application thats the reason we need java
already we insalled java for jenkins so no need to install , however we need to sen  the M2,M2_HOME path along with JAVA_HOME
	3) Need to install Maven plugin on jenkins GUI
	4) and Configure Maven and java on Jenkins GUI
in google go to maven download --> we can download Binary.tar.gz file inside /opt/ here we can download via wget 
# ta-zxvf apahe.tar.gz --> its get extracted 
mv apache-maven-3.8.3. maven
cd maven 
cd bin -->here we can find mvn command in side this directory this command works but out side it wont work for that we need 
to export the path in ~/.bash_profile
M2_HOME=/opt/maven
M2=/opt/maven/bin
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/<path>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$M2:$M2_HOME
source ~/.bash_profile
echo $PATH - > to validate 

And go to Jenkins-GUI -> ManageJenkins ->Plugins -- maven integration plugin - we need to install 
ManageJenkins- Global Tool --> add JDK & Maven installed paths

BUILD JAVA PROJECT USING JENKINS:
================================
Newitem--FirstMaven-project--select Maven project --ok 
Description --> SCM <Git-URL>--Build - clean install -Apply and OK 

===============================================================================================================================

(iii) Setup Tomcat server
=========================
	1) Linux-server or EC2 instance
	2) Instal java-11
	3) Configure tomcat
	4) Start Tomcat Server
	5) Access tomat over web GUI
Firs we need to install java-11 
Go to Google search "tomcat downlod" wget tar.gz below /opt and tar -zxvf tomcat.tar.gz and mv tomcat-xxx to tomcat 
cd /opt/tomcat/bin --> ./startup.sh to start tomcat service 
Now we can able to access via 8080 port 
But when we acces manager's app it will through error stating that update context.xml file 
got to tomcat directory and search context.xml file # find / -name contxt/xml, here we need to update host-manager and manager 
directory paths
in this two files we need to command valueClassName entry with <!--           --> like that to comment 
same lines in both files .and we need to shutdown.sh and startup.sh service .... after that we could able to get the login promt while we press manager's app , But we dont have credentials , for that 

There is a tomcat-users.xml file available below conf directory need to update couple of users like GUI admin and developer user with previlages.
After we edit the file we need to shutdown or startup the tomcat service or we can use softlink as well 
ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatup
ln -s /opt/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/local/bin/tomcatdown


(iv) Itegrating TOmcat server with Jenkins 
=======================================================
 To integrate tomcat with jenkins we need to install "Deploy to container" plugins by using this pluginn we can deploy the 
code on tomcate server. 
Next thing we need to configure tomcat-server with credentils
These two things are nessary to integrate tomcat with Jenkins 

Jenkins-GUI-> ManageJenkins-plugins-search "Deploy to Container" (This plugin allows you to deploy war file to container)

Nowe we need to configure tomcat with credentisls
ManageJenkins--Manager credentisls--jenkins--Global credentials--select username with password option 
deployer user and deployer password we need to provide 

Newitem-->Name:Build and deploy --> Maven project--ok
Description--> SCM <Git-URL> Build "clean install" --> post Build option slect "Deploy war/ear on container"
**/..war* --> add contaner slect tomcat-9 --> select credentials of server (which we allready added)
provide "tomcat url:8080" --apply and save.

As a developer pull the code to local machine and edit the source html file and update 

(v) Create CICD JOb-we are going to see how we are  build & deploy it on tomat server
=====================================================================================
(vi) Test the deployment
=========================

############## CONSISE ##############################

1) Need to setup Jenkins server
2) JAVA11, git , Maven needs to install and export M2,M2_HOME,JAVA_HOME path in jenkins server 
3) "GitHub,Deploy to Container, Maven Integration" plugins needs to install on jenkins-GUI
4) ManageJenkins->Tools->jDK-11-Path, Git-Path,Mavn-Home-Path needs to update 
5) ManageJenkins->credentials->GlobalCredentials->Add->"deployer-user-password-needs to provide"
5) New item -> SCM-> pool SCM -> Build Gols-> Add Post Build action "DeployWarEar to container"
In this Deploy to container we need to provide
	1) Tomcat server crededtials need to select
	2) Tomat server URL 
So Now The Artifact will be get deployed on Tomcat Destination Server 
####################### Deploy war/tar on Tomcat server completed ##################
