 Using Ansible to Create Containers:
#####################################

Untill previouse section we were doing changes in our workstation then commiting changes from git to GitHub
Once Latest code available on gitHub Jenkins could above to pull the latest code and build it with the help of maven and 
it was creating docker images and docker container on docker Host.
  In this case Jenkins will be acting as a Build and Deployment Tool, But is there any better way to Handle it , YES 
Thats is where we introduce deployment tool Ansible along with DockerHub

Our applications are containerized at this moment we need repository 
if in case it is not containerized application (i mean wehich we may directory deployed on vm) we can uses nexus or artifactory.
But we have reached containarized level thats is the reason we are going to use docker Hub.

With the Help of Ansible and DockerHub we are going to make this cicd more smoother.
########
In this case--> Jenkins is going to take the code from GitHUb --> Build Artifacts & copy thos artifacts on to AnsibleServer
Now it is Ansible tasks to create images and deploy the containers
Ansible is going to take the artifact and with the help of Dockerfile creats a docker image
This docker image we can commit into docker-Hub becuase dockerHub is repository to store docker images
Whenever we execute any ansible play book to deploy a container docker host (destination server) communicates with 
dockerHub pull the image whatever we mentioned in our playbook and create a container our of it .
######

"Ansible Installation"
=======================
	1) Bring the server
	2) setup Hostname
	3) Create ansadmin User
	4) Add users to sudoers file
	5) Generate SSH Keys
	6) Enable password passed login
	7) Install Ansible

# hostnmectl set-hostname ansible.example.com

# useradd ansadmin
# passwd ansadmin
# vi /etc/sudoers
# sudo su - ansadmin 
# vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config -> To enable password based authentication
To install Ansible
# yum install ansible -y 


After we setup ansible server need to prepare ansible server to create docker images 
For tha we need to add DockerHost to Ansible as a managed Node so that our ansible control node can manage docker host.
For that we need to add dockerip in ansible HOst's inventory file
# vi /etc/ansible/hosts
192.168.56.24 

We need to write a play book in our ansible control node and the palybook should run on target docker node  For that we 
need to add docker host as a managed node to ansible Host .

# To enable this feature we need to do the below 
# Create  ansadmin 
# passwd ansadmin
# Add this ansadmin to sudoers file
# Enable password based authentication # vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# we need to copy ssh key from ansible server(ansadmin) to docker host's ansadmin to enable the passwdless authentication.
# ansible -m ping <dockerip> 


##############  CONSISE ##################
On Docker Host		     On Ansible Host
--------------	             ----------------
Creaet ansadmin		     Add Host files	
add ansadmin in sudoers	     Copy SSH keys
Enable password login	     Test the connection

AnsibleHost (ansadmin) can able to commnicate with docker without any credenstials



#### INTEGRATE ANSIBLE WITH JENKINS ##############
We shoud integrate Ansible with Jenkins , So that jenkins able to copy Artifact to Ansible Server 
Ansible can able to create image and deploy container on DockerHost

By doing this Jenkins will take care only Build actities and Ansible can take care Deployment Activities
To integrate ansible server with jenkings we need to follow the same we did earlier for intergrate docker with jenkins
so for that what we did installed "Publish over ssh" plugin and already availble 
Only thing we need to "configure system" and add our ansible 
So that jenkins could able to communicate with ansible with whatever the credentials we provided in "configure systems"

Add our ansible to jenkins:
---------------------------
Go to Jenkins GUI --> manage jenkins -> Configure system --> Go to publish over ssh --> Add ssh to Ansible system
Provide the below details:
Name: Ansible-server 
HOstname: 192.168.56.23 (Ansible IP)
Username: ansadmin
Advanced -> click use password authentictation -> provide password of ansadadmin-user 
##### Testconnection ######

Now we are going to create a New Jenkins JOB where we can Build and copy the artifact into ansible system

Name: copy artifacts onto -Ansibleserver
Copy from : Build and deploy on COntainer

Go to Post-Build-Action -> Remove docker and add ansible serve credentisls
source fle : same
Removeprefix : same 
Remote Directory: //opt/docker
remove allthe commands available in Exec coloumn all docker commands 

#Save and RUN the job 


Note in Ansible server please check it create or not 
----------------------------------------------------
in Ansible server please create the directory and assign the permission 
mkdir /opt/docker
sudo chown ansadmin:ansadmin /opt/docker


# In previouse we have integrated our ansible with jenkins and copied artifacts by jenkins job to ansible server /opt/docker
# directory .
#
# Now its time to create docker-image with the help of Artifacts which we have copied on to Ansible-server
# This activity we have done previousely on our docker-host same think we we are going to do 
For that we have installed docker on our Ansible-server , we haven't done yet 
Going to install docker on ansible-server-> 
# sudo yum install docker 
Now in this ansible-server we need to add this ansadmin to docker group Then only we can execute docker commands
# usermod -aG docker ansadmin 
# systemctl status docker
# systemctl start docker
#pwd
#/opt/docker
#vi Dockerfile
vi Dockerfile
FROM tomcat:latest
RUN cp -R /usr/local/tomcat/webapps.dist/* /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
COPY ./*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps 

# docker build -t regapp:v1 . -> . for current directory
# docker run -d --name regapp-server -p 8081:8080 regapp:v1 

	
USNING ANSIBLE TO CREATE CONTAINER
==================================
Now the image is available on Ansible system
we need to make available on docker target system, This is where docker-hub comes into picture because 
Once created the image on ansible server from there we need to push the image to docker-Hub 
From DockerHub the image can be accessible by any docker system 
From ansible-server we can instruct the docker-system go and pull the image from docker-Hub & create a container
This how docker host pull the image and create a container out of it ....!!!


1) login to ansible-server to create a playbook to create an image 
sudo su - ansadmin
cd /opt/docker 
Here we shoule have Dockerfile and webapp.war file 
Here the requrement is the target server is ansible server itself , so we need to update ansible inventory file - ansible-host
[docker-host]
192.168.56.24
[ansible-host]
192.168.56.23

in ansible server - we are in below /opt/docker directory right now. Here we are going to create regapp.yaml playbook
vi regapp.yaml
---
- hosts: ansible-host
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create docker image 
      command: docker build -t regapp:latest .
      args:
        chdir: /opt/docker
Till now we have created the docker image by using ansible-playbook,and the image is available on ansible server ,  The next is need to push the docker image from Ansible-server to dockerHub.
so that our doker server able to pull the image and create container out of it .

#### Usning Ansible to create imaeg and Copy image from Ansible-server to DockerHub ########
 Till the above what we have done is we have created an docker image with the help of Ansible-playbom on ansible-server
and tag the image and push the image to docker-Hub Manually . so to automate we have goting to add some steps in 
ansible-playbook to tag and push the image to DockerHub repository

login to the ansible server go to /opt/docker 
vi reapp.yml
---
- hosts: ansible
  tasks:
  - name: create docker image
    command: docker build -t regapp:latest .
    args:
      chdir: /opt/docker
  - name: Create tag to push image into dockerHub
    command: docker tag regapp:latest vsknalli/regapp:latest

  - name: push docker image 
    command: docker push vsknalli/regapp:latest 
 
     
#### Unsing Ansible Creating Container on destination Docker Host ###############################

Now we need to create one ansible-playbook to create container on DockerHost(Our destination Host)
and the docker-Host understand we need to pull the image from dockerHub 
and Create a container out of it.....!!!
# vi deploy_regapp.yml

In ansible-server : we need to create deplpy-regapp.yml 
---
- hosts: docker
  tasks:
  - name: Create container 
    command: docker run -d --name regapp-server -p 8082:8080 vsknalli/regapp:latest
#-----------------------

When we run fist time it will run sucessfully but when we tried the secound time , we got the error stating that "the container name is already usedby another container" to overcome this problem  either we need to remove this container or 
change the name 

	> Remove the existing container
	> Rmove existing image
	> Create a New container
These are the instruction we are going to incorporate in the Ansible-playbook.
Once done we will add this Deployment ansible playbook into Jenkins so that our Jenkins can take care of entire CICD 

# This playbook stop the existing container & Remove it and create a new container with latest tag #####
---
- hosts: docker
  tasks:
  - name: Stop existing container
    command: docker stop regapp-server
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Remve the container 
    command: docker rm regapp-server
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Remove image
    command: docker rmi vsknalli/regapp:latest
    ignore_errors: yes

  - name: Create container 
    command: docker run -d --name regapp-server -p 8082:8080 vsknalli/regapp:latest
