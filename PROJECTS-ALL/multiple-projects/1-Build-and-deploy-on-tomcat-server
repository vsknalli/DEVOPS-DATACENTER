1) Build and deploy on Tomcat server 
Setup CICD with GitHub-->Jenkins-->Maven and Tomcat

(i) setup Jenkins server
=========================-
	> Setup Linux server 
	> Install Java
	> Install Jenkins
	> Start Jenkins
	> Access web UI on port 8080
After we setup the jenkins server we can try & Run First-Jenkins-job
Newitem --> Enter item Name --> Freestyle --> Description --> Build ...etc..etc.


(ii) Setup and configure Maven and Git
========================================
		We are in the process of setting up pipeline to build out code for this sofar we have installed Jenkins
and our code is on our GitHub.
		Usally to pull the code from GitHub or anyvesion contrll system our system show have Git, Similar way to pull
the code onto jenkins we should install Git over jenkins-server , so on Jenkins cli first we need to insall git and 
then we can integrate GitHub with Jenkins on the GUI.

Steps:
-----
	1) First we need to install Git on Jenkins-server on cli
           # apt install git
	2) Install GitHub plugin on Jenkins-GUI After that 
           manageJenkins-->plugins-->github-->install withour restart  (Because i want integrate GitHub to Jenkins)
	3) Configure Git on Jenkins-GUI
	   ManageJenkins-->GlbalTool-->to to Git installation give the git path
These are the three stypes we shoull follow

RUN FIRST JOB PULL CODE FROM GITHUB:
===================================
Newitem-> jobname->Freestyle-ok---->Decription--> SCM-<URL> --> Apply and Save it --> BuildJOb
Successfully cloned on to our jenkins servers in workspace (in server path /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<JObName> see in
Jenkinsserver in this path.)
	
INTEGRARE MAVEN WITH JENKINS:
=============================
Normally we can user Maven as a seperate Build server , to reduce the complexcivy here we are using Jenkins server as 
as Build server for that 
	1) setup Maven on Jenkins server
	2) we Need to setup Environment Variable, Maven is a java based application thats the reason we need java
already we insalled java for jenkins so no need to install , however we need to sen  the M2,M2_HOME path along with JAVA_HOME
	3) Need to install Maven plugin on jenkins GUI
	4) and Configure Maven and java on Jenkins GUI
in google go to maven download --> we can download Binary.tar.gz file inside /opt/ here we can download via wget 
# ta-zxvf apahe.tar.gz --> its get extracted 
mv apache-maven-3.8.3. maven
cd maven 
cd bin -->here we can find mvn command in side this directory this command works but out side it wont work for that we need 
to export the path in ~/.bash_profile
M2_HOME=/opt/maven
M2=/opt/maven/bin
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/<path>
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME:$M2:$M2_HOME
source ~/.bash_profile
echo $PATH - > to validate 

And go to Jenkins-GUI -> ManageJenkins ->Plugins -- maven integration plugin - we need to install 
ManageJenkins- Global Tool --> add JDK & Maven installed paths








(iii) Setup Tomcat server
=========================
(iv) Itegrating GitHub,Maven,TOmcat server with Jenkins 
=======================================================
(v) Create CICD JOb-we are going to see how we are  build & deploy it on tomat server
=====================================================================================
(vi) Test the deployment
=========================
